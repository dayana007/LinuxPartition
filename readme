# Linux_Partition
make -f MakeTest clean 

	Will remove all the generated binaries, out files and report pdfs and texts

make -f MakeTest

	Will compile all the test suits. Needs installation of the PThread library which is used
	to create threads.

make -f MakeTest run_T0

	Will run the Test suit 0, which performs direct value assignment to array elements
	5 Threads assign direct value to a 20 MB array and the test runs for 5 seconds.
	The minimum duration and maximum duration in nanoseconds for each thread is 
	captured in a 1MB sized array.

make -f MakeTest run_T1

	Will run the Test suit 1

make -f MakeTest run_T2

	Will run the Test suit 2

make -f MakeTest run_T3

	Will run the Test suit 3

make -f MakeTest run_T4

	Will run the Test suit 4, which performs recursive calls for fixed exit condition, using post recursion
	schedule point task wait. The recursive calls are made for 5 threads and the test case is run for 5 seconds

make -f MakeTest run_T5

	Will run the Test suit 5, which performs recursive calls for fixed exit condition, using pre recursion
	schedule point task wait. The recursive calls are made for 5 threads and the test case is run for 5 seconds

make -f MakeTest run_T6

	Will run the Test suit 6, which performs recursive calls for variable exit condition, therefore variable
	dynamic stack consumption

make -f MakeTest report

	Will generate a report for test case execution. Will probably need installation of PDF related Python packages
